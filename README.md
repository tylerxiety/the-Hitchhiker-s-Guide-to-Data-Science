# The Hitchhiker's Guide to Data Science

I put all the notes of online and on-campus data science courses and learning activities here. For me, it's putting all the pieces togather and then easier to do some reflection and comparison. For others, I hope it'll be useful.

- [Machine Learning by Stanford Uni on Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning) (Currently on Week 7)

**Machine Learning**: A program is said to learn from experience E with respect to tasks T and performance measure P, if its performance at tasks in T, as measured by P, improves with experience E. In general, it has two broad classifications: Supervised learning and Unsupervised learning.

**Supervised Learning**: Data has labels. Categorized into "regression" and "classification" problems.

**Unsupervised Learning**: No labels. Categorized into "clustering" and "non-clustering" (e.g., the "Cocktail Party Algorithm") problems.

### Supervised Learning

**Supervised Learning Models**: A hypothesis function H to predict the corresponding value Y of input X (i.e., H : X â†’ Y). The accuracy of the function h is measured by a **cost function** J. 

**Gradient Descent**: A method to estimate the parameters in the hypothesis function h by finding the minimum value of the cost function J, which is taking the derivative of cost function J as a function of the parameter estimates.

**Model/function Types**:
- **Linear Regression**: A linear function to model the relationship between dependent variable Y and one or more independent variables X. Linear regression with multiple variables is also known as **Multivariate Linear Regression**.

\begin{align}
\dot{x} & = \sigma(y-x) \\
\dot{y} & = \rho x - y - xz \\
\dot{z} & = -\beta z + xy
\end{align}
