# The Hitchhiker's Guide to Data Science

I put all the notes of online and on-campus data science courses and learning activities here. For me, it's putting all the pieces togather and then easier to do some reflection and comparison. For others, I hope it'll be useful.

**Machine Learning**: A program is said to learn from experience E with respect to tasks T and performance measure P, if its performance at tasks in T, as measured by P, improves with experience E. In general, it has two broad classifications: Supervised learning and Unsupervised learning.
